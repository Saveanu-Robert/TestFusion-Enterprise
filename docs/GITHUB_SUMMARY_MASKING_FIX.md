# GitHub Actions Summary Masking Fix

## Problem Description

GitHub Actions was masking certain values in workflow job summaries, displaying `***` instead of the actual values. This was happening because GitHub's secret masking system was being overly aggressive in protecting potentially sensitive information.

## Root Cause

The issue occurred when using GitHub context expressions directly in shell scripts within the workflow steps. GitHub Actions interprets certain patterns as potentially sensitive and masks them, including:

- Matrix values (`${{ matrix.test-type }}`)
- Input values (`${{ github.event.inputs.* }}`)
- Some context variables when used in specific patterns

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment Variable Approach

Instead of using GitHub context expressions directly in shell scripts, we now pass them as environment variables to the step:

```yaml
- name: Create PR test summary
  if: always()
  env:
    JOB_STATUS: ${{ job.status }}
    COMMIT_SHA: ${{ github.sha }}
    PR_NUM: ${{ github.event.number }}
    HEAD_REF: ${{ github.head_ref }}
    TEST_TYPE_VAR: ${{ matrix.test-type }}
    REPO_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}
    RUN_ID: ${{ github.run_id }}
  run: |
    # Use environment variables instead of context expressions
    echo "Test Type: ${TEST_TYPE_VAR}"
    echo "PR Number: ${PR_NUM}"
```

### 2. Shell Case Statements

Replaced bash `if` statements with `case` statements for better pattern matching and to avoid potential masking triggers:

```bash
# Before (potentially masked)
if [[ "${{ job.status }}" == "success" ]]; then

# After (not masked)
case "$JOB_STATUS" in
  "success")
```

### 3. String Manipulation in Shell

Used shell parameter expansion instead of external commands where possible:

```bash
# Extract short commit hash
COMMIT_SHORT="${COMMIT_SHA:0:8}"
```

## Files Updated

### 1. `.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml`
- Updated "Create PR test summary" step
- Added environment variables for all context values
- Replaced conditional logic with case statements

### 2. `.github/workflows/manual-tests.yml`
- Updated "Generate test results summary" step
- Updated "Create enhanced job summary" step
- Added environment variables for all context values
- Replaced conditional logic with case statements

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **No More Masking**: Values are properly displayed in job summaries
2. **Better Security**: Actual secrets are still protected
3. **Cleaner Code**: More readable shell scripts
4. **Consistent Output**: Reliable display of workflow information
5. **Future-Proof**: Less likely to be affected by GitHub Actions changes

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. Create a test PR or run a manual workflow
2. Check the job summary for proper display of:
   - Test type
   - PR number
   - Branch name
   - Commit hash
   - Workflow run ID

All these values should now display correctly instead of showing `***`.

## Additional Notes

- This approach maintains the same functionality while avoiding the masking issue
- The fix is backward compatible and doesn't affect existing workflow logic
- Environment variables are scoped to individual steps, maintaining security
- No changes to actual secret handling were required

## Best Practices for Future Workflows

1. Always use environment variables when passing GitHub context to shell scripts
2. Avoid using `${{ }}` expressions directly in complex shell logic
3. Use case statements instead of if statements for status checks
4. Test job summaries after making workflow changes
5. Document any context variables that might be sensitive
