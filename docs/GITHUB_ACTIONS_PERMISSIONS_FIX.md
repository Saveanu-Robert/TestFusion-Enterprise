## ‚úÖ GitHub Actions Permissions Issue Fixed

I've successfully created a new branch `fix-github-actions-permissions` and resolved the GitHub Actions integration error. Here's what was accomplished:

### üîç **Root Cause Analysis**
The error `Resource not accessible by integration` occurred because:
- GitHub Actions workflows have restricted permissions by default
- The workflow was trying to create commit comments without proper permissions
- Missing explicit permission declarations in workflow files
- Malformed URLs in job summaries

### üõ†Ô∏è **Solutions Implemented**

#### 1. **Added Explicit Permissions to All Workflows**

**Manual Tests Workflow:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
  checks: write
  pull-requests: write
  issues: write
```

**PR Tests Workflow:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
  checks: write
  pull-requests: write
```

**Dependency Bot Workflow:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: read
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Job Summaries with Professional Formatting**
- **Before**: Basic text summaries with broken links
- **After**: Comprehensive markdown tables, emojis, and proper artifact instructions

#### 3. **Fixed URL Generation Issues**
- **Issue**: Malformed URLs like `https://github.com/repo/actions/runs/***github.com***repo***actions***runs***123`
- **Solution**: Proper GitHub context variable usage with clear instructions

#### 4. **Improved User Experience**
The new approach provides:
- ‚úÖ **Professional Tables**: Clean, structured information display
- ‚úÖ **Status Emojis**: Visual indicators for test results
- ‚úÖ **Artifact Instructions**: Clear download and usage guidance
- ‚úÖ **Next Steps**: Actionable recommendations based on test results
- ‚úÖ **Better Security**: Uses minimal required permissions

## Files Modified

1. `.github/workflows/manual-tests.yml` - Complete rewrite with proper permissions and job summaries
2. `.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml` - Added explicit permissions
3. `.github/workflows/dependency-bot.yml` - Added explicit permissions

## How to View Test Results

### Manual Tests
1. Go to the Actions tab in the repository
2. Click on the manual test workflow run
3. View the job summary directly in the interface
4. Download artifacts for detailed reports

### PR Tests
Test results are automatically uploaded as artifacts and can be downloaded from the workflow run page.

### Dependency Bot
Creates GitHub issues automatically when security vulnerabilities are detected.

## Testing the Fix

To test the fix:

1. Trigger a manual workflow run from the Actions tab
2. Select test type, browser, and environment
3. Monitor the workflow execution
4. Verify that no permission errors occur
5. Check that the job summary displays correctly
6. Verify artifacts are uploaded successfully

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always specify explicit permissions** in GitHub Actions workflows
2. **Use job summaries** instead of commit comments when possible
3. **Test workflows** in a development environment before merging
4. **Monitor workflow runs** for permission-related errors
